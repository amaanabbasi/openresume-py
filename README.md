# openresume-py
This repository contains a Python script for parsing and extracting information from resume PDF files using PyMuPDF (fitz). The script identifies sections such as Profile, Experience, Education, Projects, and Skills, and extracts relevant details like job titles, company names, dates, etc. The parsed data is then structured in a dictionary format.
